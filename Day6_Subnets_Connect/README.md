n this project you are given a network 192.168.40.0 and are required to subnet it to create 2 subnets for Accounts and Delivery departments.
We have added a router and 2 swwitches.
The router acts as a inter-vlan routing and a DHCP server.
We end up having the subnets having network addresses of 192.168.40.0 and 192.168.40.128.
I have implemented basic security with the router and switches securing console line and enable privilege command and encrypted the passwords with service password-encrption command.
router - mainr0ut3r
Accounts swicth - sw1tch@ccounts
Delivery switch - sw1tchd3livery
The departments each has 2 PCs and a printer each aquiring their ip addresses automatically with DHCP from router.
